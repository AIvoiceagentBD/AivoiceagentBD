### 🇧🇩 Building Bangladesh’s First AI Voice Agent

---

## About Us

We're two friends on a bold mission: to create the first AI voice agent in Bangladesh. Neither of us are developers (yet!), but we're passionate learners committed to growing our skills and building something meaningful for our country.

We believe in learning by doing—and we’re documenting every step of our journey, from breakthroughs to missteps. If you're curious about how two non-coders are diving headfirst into AI, you're in the right place.
